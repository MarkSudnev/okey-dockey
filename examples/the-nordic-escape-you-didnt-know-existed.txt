With Swedish farmhouses, Viking churches and €4 fika, Estonia feels profoundly Nordic, without the eye-watering price tag.

I am cycling around Vormsi Island. Road signs in Swedish point me past red-rust wooden farmhouses flying blue and yellow flags, alongside windswept Baltic beaches and through shady pine forests. I stop for fika – that most Swedish of rituals, coffee and cinnamon buns – and post a photo on social media. "Where in the world?" I type.

The guesses roll in: Sweden? Norway? Finland? All could be right. Everything feels Scandinavian – except the price of the fika: just €4.

I am in Estonia, a place I had always thought of as "Eastern European" but which could justifiably claim to be the sixth Nordic nation – with similar landscapes, language and cuisine, but without the eye-watering prices.
