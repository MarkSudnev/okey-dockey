On Peru's desert hillsides, archaeologists have uncovered a 3,800-year-old city that may reshape our understanding of the cradle of civilisation in the Americas.

Four hours north of Lima, the ochre slopes of the Supe Valley seem inhospitable: windswept plains, crumbled adobe walls and the shimmer of heat rising from the desert. It's hard to imagine that these dry slopes once supported one of the world's first great civilisations – and that, once-buried beneath this desert, a new discovery is rewriting the history of the Americas.

In July 2025, Peruvian archaeologist Dr Ruth Shady unveiled Peñico, a 3,800 year-old city of Peru's ancient Caral civilisation. The newly excavated site features 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential compounds. Most importantly, it provides fresh evidence that the Caral people adapted to climate disaster without turning to war – a survival strategy that feels as extraordinary today as it must have been millennia ago.

"Peñico continues the Caral civilisation's vision of life without conflicts," said Shady, who has led research in the valley for three decades.
