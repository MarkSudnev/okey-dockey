Paul Mescal has said that comparisons between his new film and Brokeback Mountain are "lazy and frustrating", but it's hardly surprising that those comparisons have been made. After all, The History of Sound, like Brokeback Mountain, is a handsome period drama about two young men who have a passionate relationship while they are out in the American countryside together, and who can't admit to their feelings when they're back home. Not that the two films are identical. Oliver Hermanus's drama, adapted from Ben Shattack's short story, is about musicologists (Mescal and Josh O'Connor) hiking around Maine in 1920, recording folk songs in the communities they visit. "What's most special about The History of Sound is how timelessly classical it feels," says Tomris Laffly in Elle. "Its continents-spanning scope and journey through the unique sounds and musical notes of the olden Americana put you inside the pages of a great, lost novel, all the way through the movie's richly earned, Atonement-like ending."
