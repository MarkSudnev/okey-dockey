US rapper Cardi B has returned with her first album in seven years, a blistering collection of songs that reference her recent divorce and ongoing beef with another female rapper.

Am I The Drama? - a title inspired by a RuPaul's Drag Race meme - was released on Friday, and is her first full-length album since her 2018 debut Invasion of Privacy.

Rolling Stone described the rapper's sophomore record as a "fittingly grand return for a queen who never left the throne".

Fans welcomed the return of rap's "queen of chaos" as they dissected the album's bracingly honest lyrics.

The US star references her 2024 divorce from rapper Offset, formerly of hip-hop group Migos, rapping: "Last time you [messed] up, I said I was done / Messed up again, I took you back, I was dumb / Should've fell back from you, instead, I gave you a son."

She also raps about his apparent infidelity, commenting that she "could've cheated too".

But she also reflects on her own role in their break-up, telling him: "As a wife I should have realised when you were hurt / But instead I put my music first."

Elsewhere, Cardi B escalates her ongoing beef with fellow rapper Bia, saying her rival's "melatonin flow [is] putting us to bed".

She also challenges listeners to "name five Bia songs, gun pointing to your head", adding that Bia's record label should be thankful for the publicity from the fallout, rapping: "I'm doing you a favour, Epic."

In a 4.5-star reivew, Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield noted: "She's got a long list of scores to settle, enemies to crush, crowns to claim.

"She's out to remind everyone she's looser, wilder, less predictable, just plain funnier than anyone else in the game."
