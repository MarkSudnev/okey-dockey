An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone.

Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads.

The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation.

At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, "If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes."

"It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena," says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor.

The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car.

The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport.

Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year.

"I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion," says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot.

"We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective."

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation.
